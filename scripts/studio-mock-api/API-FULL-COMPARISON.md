# Supabase Studio API vs Supastack — Full Coverage

**Legend:**
| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Implemented in Supastack (real backing logic) |
| 🔧 | Partial / platform stub — route exists and returns a valid (often empty/static) payload so Studio renders, but has no real backing yet |
| 🔀 | Proxy only — forward to per-instance Kong/service (`http://localhost:{portKong}/...`) |
| ❌ | Missing — no route (404), needs platform-level logic |
| 🚫 | Out of scope (billing, Stripe, marketplace, enterprise) |

> Updated for **feature 084** (control-plane GoTrue auth + multi-tenant orgs + Cloud RBAC) and **feature 025** (shared Studio `IS_PLATFORM=true`). Human session auth is now served by a real GoTrue at `/auth/v1/*` (Caddy → `auth:9999`); profile, organizations, members, invitations, roles and personal access tokens are real platform endpoints at `/api/v1/platform/*`. Feature 025 added a broad set of platform stubs so Studio's pages render without errors.

**Coverage (302 total rows):**
| Status | Count | % |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ Covered (real backing) | 78 | 26% |
| 🔧 Partial / platform stub | 141 | 47% |
| 🔀 Proxy only (add route → forward to Kong) | 48 | 16% |
| ❌ Missing (needs platform-level logic) | 27 | 9% |
| 🚫 Out of scope (billing/Stripe/marketplace) | 8 | 3% |

> Most of the 🔧 jump vs. earlier revisions is feature 025: it stubs ~130 platform routes (replication, org apps/OAuth, disk, content, notifications, integrations, analytics usage, feedback, …) with valid empty/static payloads so Studio renders, pending real backends.

## Auth (Session)

> Feature 084: served by the real control-plane GoTrue at `/auth/v1/*` (Caddy → `auth:9999`). No more `sb_sid` session / `studio-gotrue` shim. **TOTP MFA (enroll → challenge → verify → unenroll) works natively** — verified live on supaviser.dev; nothing was built for it. Only the org-level *MFA enforcement policy* (`/members/mfa/enforcement`) remains a stub.
