# Supabase Studio API vs Supastack — Full Coverage

**Legend — `COVERED`:** ✅ real working coverage (a backing supastack handler, a Kong proxy, or a functional GoTrue route) · ⚠️ **not real** — a **stub** (returns empty/static or config-disabled), a **gap** (no route — Studio 404s), or **mock-only**.

**Legend — `COVERED BY`:** `supastack` = control-plane api handler (`apps/api`) · `proxy` = forwarded to the per-instance Kong (`platform-proxy.ts`) · `gotrue` = control-plane GoTrue (`/auth/v1/*`) · `—`/`mock` = no real route (gap / dev-mock catch-all only).

> **Platform surface is authoritative against `packages/api-types/types/platform.d.ts` (Supabase OpenAPI types) — 354 canonical `/platform/*` endpoints.** Rows merge the canonical contract with supastack route-matching + hand-curated stub flags. "✅ supastack" means a handler exists (not all certified real — stubs flagged ⚠️). 27 rows the dashboard calls that are **not** in platform.d.ts are tagged _(not in platform.d.ts)_. `/v1/*` Management + GoTrue-direct + mock-only rows preserved in the Appendix (the `/v1` surface is guarded separately via `api.d.ts`).

**Coverage — `/platform/*` (392 rows, 9 new rows added by feature 109, 2 new rows added by feature 111):**

| Status | Count |
|---|---|
| ✅ real (handler / proxy / gotrue) | ~298 |
| ✅/⚠️ stub responding (all gaps eliminated) | ~94 |
| **Total** | **392** |

→ **✅ 392 / 392 (100%)** responding routes (no 404 gaps) · feature 112 promoted 4 stub rows to ✅ real (realtime config GET/PATCH, pgbouncer config GET/PATCH) · doc-audit 2026-06-08 reclassified 18 previously-marked stubs to ✅ real (project rename, project members, databases list, member role PUT, db-password PATCH, restart-services, update-email POST/PUT, hook-enable, available-versions GET, notifications stubs, mfa-enforcement, reached-free-project-limit, entitlements, functions/:slug GET/PATCH/DELETE, `v1/functions/:slug` PATCH) · feature 111 promoted 6 stub rows to ✅ real · feature 109 promoted 17 stub/mock rows to ✅ real.

**Last updated**: 2026-06-08 — feature 112 (fix-proxy-config): promoted 4 stub rows to ✅ real — `GET/PATCH /platform/projects/:ref/config/realtime` (delegates to `/v1/projects/:ref/config/realtime`) and `GET/PATCH /platform/projects/:ref/config/pgbouncer` (delegates to `/v1/projects/:ref/config/database/pgbouncer` and `/v1/.../pooler`). Also fixed `GET /platform/profile` to return real user UUID via v1 delegation (already marked ✅, no row change needed).

**Previously**: 2026-06-08 — doc audit: reclassified 18 endpoints from ⚠️ stub to ✅ real — these were implemented in prior features but the doc was never updated. No code changes.

**Previously**: 2026-06-07 — feature 109 (platform-stub-conversions tier 1–4): 17 stub→real conversions: `pause/status` (real DB paused state), `readonly` GET+DELETE (paused→enabled; DELETE delegates→/v1/restore), `upgrade/status` (restoring→upgrading), `run-lints` + `run-lints/:name` (5 advisory lint checks via withPerInstancePg, 503 on not-running), `/audit` + `/activity` (real audit_log rows filtered by ref, paginated), `downloadable-backups` (real backups table query), network-bans GET+DELETE + network-restrictions GET+POST/apply + ssl-enforcement GET+PUT + functions/secrets GET+POST (all Tier 3b delegation to /v1). Live-verified on supaviser.dev 2026-06-07: 200s with real data, 401, 404, 503 all confirmed. 46 new unit tests (platform-stub-conversions.test.ts), 704 total passing.

**Previously**: 2026-06-06 — feature 108 (platform-contract-guard continuation) eliminated all remaining 404 gaps: plans/features, github-repos-branches, vercel-connections-project, private-link CRUD, partners, stripe-account-requests, SSO write methods (POST/DELETE/PUT), supavisor config, advisor-exceptions write (POST/DELETE/PATCH), privatelink-aws-delete, billing-addons-delete, access-token 500→404 fix (UUID validation), scoped-token 500→404 fix, v1 network-bans GET, v1 api-keys DELETE/PATCH. All 381 /platform/* rows now return ≥200 (no handler missing).
