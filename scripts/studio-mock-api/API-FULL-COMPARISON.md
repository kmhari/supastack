# Supabase Studio API vs Supastack — Full Coverage

**Legend — `COVERED`:**
| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Real, working coverage — a backing supastack endpoint, a Kong proxy, or a functional GoTrue route |
| ⚠️ | **Not real coverage** — a **stub** (supastack/gotrue route that returns empty/static or is config-disabled) **or mock-only** (real api 404s; only the dev mock's catch-all answers). Don't rely on it. |

**Legend — `COVERED BY`:**
| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `supastack` | Endpoint in the control-plane api (`apps/api`). ✅ = real backing; ⚠️ = stub (flagged "(stub)" / "(empty)"). |
| `proxy` | Forwarded to the per-instance Kong gateway (`http://localhost:{portKong}/...`). All real (✅). |
| `gotrue` | Served by the control-plane GoTrue at `/auth/v1/*` (Caddy → `auth:9999`). ✅ = functional; ⚠️ = config-disabled (`signup`, `authorize`). |
| `mock` | Only the dev mock (`scripts/studio-mock-api/server.js`) answers via its `/platform/*` + `/v1/*` catch-all; **not** in the real api (⚠️ gap). |

> Updated for **feature 084** (control-plane GoTrue auth + multi-tenant orgs + Cloud RBAC) and **feature 025** (shared Studio `IS_PLATFORM=true`). Human session auth is served by a real GoTrue at `/auth/v1/*`; profile, organizations, members, invitations, roles and PATs are real platform endpoints at `/api/v1/platform/*`; feature 025 added a broad set of `supastack` **stubs** (⚠️) so Studio's pages render pending real backends.

**Coverage (302 total rows):**

| Covered by | Total | ✅ real | ⚠️ stub/gap/broken |
|---|---|---|---|
| `supastack` | 198 | 57 | 141 |
| `proxy` → Kong | 48 | 48 | 0 |
| `gotrue` | 21 | 19 | 2 |
| `mock` | 35 | 0 | 35 |
| **Total** | **302** | **124 (41%)** | **178 (59%)** |

→ **✅ 124 / 302 (41%)** real, working coverage · **⚠️ 178 (59%)** not-real = stubs + 35 mock-only gaps + 2 broken (auth-config case mismatch).

## Auth (Session)

> Feature 084: served by the real control-plane GoTrue at `/auth/v1/*` (Caddy → `auth:9999`). No more `sb_sid` session / `studio-gotrue` shim. **TOTP MFA (enroll → challenge → verify → unenroll) works natively** — verified live on supaviser.dev; nothing was built for it. Only the org-level *MFA enforcement policy* (`/members/mfa/enforcement`) remains a stub.

## Auth Config (GoTrue settings per project)

> ⚠️ **Field-name case mismatch (broken from Studio).** The bridge (`platform-misc.ts`) re-injects Studio's body verbatim to the Management API `/v1/projects/:ref/config/auth`, whose schema is `.strict()` lowercase snake_case (`external_github_enabled`). Studio (IS_PLATFORM) sends **UPPERCASE** GoTrue-env names (`EXTERNAL_GITHUB_ENABLED`) → PATCH 400 `unknown_field` (masked as 500); GET returns lowercase keys Studio can't read. The Management API `/v1/*` path (CLI, lowercase) works. Fix: bidirectional case translation in the bridge. GoTrue itself exposes **no** config-write API — config is env-driven (verified: `/admin/config` 404), so the env-rewrite+restart mechanism is correct.
